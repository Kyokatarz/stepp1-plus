# stepp1-plus
Modified version of StepP1 1.0.3 (5-panel focused StepMania fork), originally developed by xMax (v. 1.0.0), with further binary modifications and theme decryption by SheepyChris and Team CrackItUp (1.0.1 to 1.0.3). This repository only covers slight lua modifications to the theme and aims to add qol features to the game intended for power users.

## Installation Instructions
- Clone the repository (click the green "Code" button, then choose "Download ZIP"). We recommend downloading and setting up Github Desktop or similar to easily sync updates.
- The stepp1-plus-main folder can be stored on your location of choice. It is a portable installation and will not write files to anywhere else.
- Do not install over a previous StepP1 installation. If you want to, move or copy your SongMovies, RandomMovies and Songs folders from other installations to the main stepp1-plus folder.
- To install songs, simfiles and background animations, follow the usual Stepmania standards. Read the provided Manual on https://github.com/rayden-61/stepp1-plus/blob/main/Documentation/Manual_EN.pdf (english) or https://github.com/rayden-61/stepp1-plus/blob/main/Documentation/Manual_EN.pdf (spanish)
- Save files are compatible with stepp1-plus, and the game will automatically try to convert your old scores using the P.Score formula. We recommend migrating saves as they'll help populate the song duration metric for each song.
- We do not recommend migrating and old Save/PreferenceP1.ini file. Use the provided default PreferenceP1 and change your settings in-game (press Scroll Lock to access the in-game settings menu).
